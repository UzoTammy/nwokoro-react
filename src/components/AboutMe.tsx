                Graduate of the Federal University of Technology in Nigeria,
                as a Chemical Engineer. My career began with a flourish, as I
                gained valuable project management experience at Shell Nigeria Gas Ltd, just after graduation. This
                one-year stint was not just a job; it was a foundation that set the tone for my diverse career path.
                Through my time in the university, I developed my skills in programming.

                Following my time at Shell, I ventured into the distribution sector. Here, I didn't just adapt; I
                transformed the company. Led it's computerized operations and streamlined processes, marking a
                significant leap in efficiency and effectiveness. This achievement landed me the role of Business Operations Manager.

                The entrepreneurial spirit in me then took the helm, leading to the founding of my own business.
                Specializing in the investment and redistribution of alcoholic beverages, I navigated the complex
                landscape of this industry with skill and determination. This venture wasn't just a business; it was a
                testament to my ability to identify opportunities and capitalize on them.
